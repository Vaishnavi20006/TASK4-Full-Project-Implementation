  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a motivated B.Tech student with a strong interest in software engineering and web development. I have hands-on experience building responsive and interactive web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Through academic projects and internships, I have developed practical skills in frontend development, UI design, and JavaScript logic, including features such as local storage, data filtering, and sorting mechanisms.

I am continuously learning new technologies and enjoy solving real-world problems through clean, efficient code. My goal is to grow as a software engineer and contribute to impactful, user-focused applications.</p>
